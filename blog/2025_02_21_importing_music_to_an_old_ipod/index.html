<h1>How to import music to an old iPod Nano using a VM</h1>
<p>I've recently rediscovered my old iPod Nano and wanted to add some music to it.
I spent some time testing various software options available for Ubuntu, including libgpod, gtkpod, and even some Python scripts, but none of them worked for my iPod Nano 3rd generation.</p>
<p>After much trial and error, I found a solution that should stand the test of time: running iTunes through a Windows XP virtual machine.
I hope that this is a robust approach that will continue working for years to come.</p>
<h2>Setting Up the Virtual Machine Environment</h2>
<p>First, we need to set up KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) on Ubuntu. Start by installing KVM and its required components and adding your user to the necessary groups to manage virtual machines.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager
sudo adduser $USER libvirt
sudo adduser $USER kvm
</code></pre>
<p>Enable and start the libvirt service and verify that everything is working correctly.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
sudo systemctl start libvirtd
virsh list --all
</code></pre>
<p>Launch Virtual Machine Manager using the command: <code>virt-manager</code>.</p>
<h2>Setting Up Windows XP</h2>
<p>I am using Windows XP because it's easy to install and that's what I used when I first got my iPod.</p>
<p>Download the <a href="https://archive.org/details/en_windows_xp_professional_with_service_pack_3_x86_cd_vl_x14-73974_202202">Windows XP Professional SP3 ISO</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/i-tunes-setup-12.1.3.6-windows-xp-32-bit">iTunes for WinXP</a> from the Internet Archive.
Then install the ISO and activate it using the activation keys from this GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/Fuwn/xp">Windows XP Keys</a></p>
<h2>Connecting Your iPod</h2>
<p>In my testing, regular USB drives and internet connectivity were problematic in the VM. However, I could use the iPod itself as a storage device to transfer the necessary files.
Before starting the VM, I connect the iPod to my computer via USB and use it as a storage device to save the iTunes.exe and my music files.</p>
<p>Then I start the VM and connect and pass the iPod to the VM via USB passthrough. (On KVM it's done by clicking <code>Add New Hardware</code> =&gt; <code>USB Host Device</code> =&gt; <code>select the iPod from the list</code>)</p>
<p>After doing this, the iPod should now appear as a drive in Windows XP.
Copy the iTunes installer and the music files to Windows XP and install iTunes.</p>
<p>Once iTunes is installed and running, you should be able to use it normally to manage your iPod. The software will recognize your device and allow you to sync music.</p>
